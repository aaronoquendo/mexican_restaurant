# Images Directory

## Note: Online Royalty-Free Images

This website now uses direct links to royalty-free images from Unsplash instead of local image files. This means:

1. You don't need to download or add any images to this directory
2. The website is immediately functional with beautiful images
3. Internet connection is required to display the images

## Current Image Sources

All images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), which provides high-quality royalty-free images that can be used without attribution (though attribution is appreciated by photographers).

## If You Want to Use Local Images

If you prefer to use local images instead of the online links:

1. Download appropriate images for each section of the website
2. Save them in this directory with descriptive names
3. Update the image src attributes in the HTML files to point to your local images
4. Update the background image URLs in the CSS file

- Gallery images: Square format recommended (e.g., 800px × 800px)
- Testimonial profile image: 200px × 200px (square format)
